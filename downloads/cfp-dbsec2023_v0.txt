Paper Submissions

To be defined

Submitted papers should be at most 16 pages in the LNCS format excluding bibliography and well-marked appendices, and at most 20 pages in total. Committee members are not required to read the appendices, and therefore the paper should be intelligible without them. 

All submissions must be written in English, and only PDF files will be accepted (a Latex source file will be required for the final version of the accepted papers). The final version of the accepted papers must be in the format required for publications in the LNCS
series. Submissions not meeting these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits.

Submissions are to be made to the submission web site at
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=dbsec2022 (Will be made available around mid-February)

Papers must be received by the deadline of April 22, 2022 (AOE, Firm).

Authors of accepted papers must guarantee that their papers will be presented at the conference. Accepted papers will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.

A paper submitted to DBSec 2022 cannot be under review for any other conference or journal during the time it is being considered for DBSec 2022. Furthermore, after you submit to DBSec 2022, you must await our response before submitting elsewhere. If you submit your paper to another conference or journal either before/after submission of the paper to DBSec 2022, the paper will be rejected without review and the other conference/journal will be notified as well. This restriction applies to identical as well as to substantially similar papers.

The conference proceedings will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.

DBSec2022 will have best paper and best student paper awards. Outstanding papers will be invited for possible publication in a special issue of the Journal of Computer Security.
